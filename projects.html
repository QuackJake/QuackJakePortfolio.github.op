                        &nbsp;    This is one of my most recent final projects for Business Web Development.
                        The project was to emulate a popular cereal brand's website and create a spinoff of
                        one of their most popular cereals. The website was to be designed specifically to
                        follow popular Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Guidelines to generate clicks and user engagement.
                        Another goal of the project was to familiarize ourselves with the process of creating and hosting websites
                        with a Content Management System (CMS) rather than code the entire thing ourselves.

                        &nbsp;    The Work Breakdown Chart seen above looks complicated but is quite simple.
                        We formed small groups of four members and begun planning the implementation of a 
                        fictional drone delivery service named "Drone-Tech". We were to act as project managers
                        and communicators between the Drone-Tech company and the Wilmont company that is financing
                        the project. The chart is a smaller part of the whole project, but in short is a breakdown 
                        of tasks, timelines for said tasks, and any overlap that the tasks may have. The purpose
                        of this chart is to provide stakeholders and managers with a reasonable timeline for task
                        completion as well as keeping the teams on track.

                        &nbsp;    For my Statistics final I was tasked with doing my own sort of analysis as well
                        as presenting the information in a clear legible format. The focus of my project was asking
                        friends and coworkers a few questions regarding hours of phyiscal activity per week and general
                        wellbeing and mental state. I was then tasked to use T and Z charts to draw any sort of correlations 
                        between the two and then present any evidence I had found.
